# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Jongkuk Lim
**Date:** 2025-12-08T09:03:58.734Z

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Product naming for CLI dashboard tracking vibe coding workflow states across multiple projects

**Goals:** Generate memorable, distinctive product name candidates that are:
- CLI-friendly (short, easy to type)
- Conveys workflow/project management clarity for vibe coding methodologies
- Available for branding (GitHub repo, domain names)
- Resonates with developers using vibe coding methods (BMAD-Method, Speckit)

### Session Setup

**Current Working Name:** "vibe" (placeholder)

**Product Context:**
- CLI dashboard for tracking workflow state across multiple vibe coding projects
- Detects methodology stages (BMAD-Method, Speckit)
- Real-time monitoring with smart filtering
- Helps developers manage 3-10+ simultaneous AI-assisted projects
- Key insight: Eliminates "what was I doing?" context reconstruction

**Naming Criteria:**
- Memorable and distinctive
- Short and typeable (CLI command)
- Conveys purpose (clarity, workflow, dashboard)
- Available for GitHub/domain registration
- Appeals to developer audience

## Technique Execution Results

### Technique 1: Word Association (7 minutes)

**Core Concept Associations:**
- WORKFLOW STATE → manage, lazy, vision, stress, watching
- INSTANT CLARITY → click, smart, supervision, spy, coffee
- COMMAND LINE / ALWAYS RUNNING / FLOW STATE → home, hidden worker, river

**Key Insights:**
- "River/flow" metaphor resonated strongly (continuous, always moving)
- "Hidden worker" captured agent monitoring concept
- "Coffee" suggests morning ritual (Jeff's morning test from PRD)
- "Watching/spy/supervision" emphasized monitoring aspect

### Technique 2: Analogical Thinking (7 minutes)

**CLI Name Pattern Analysis:**
- Short & memorable: git, vim, tmux, k9s
- Action-oriented: watch, tail, grep
- Metaphors: docker (shipping), yarn (weaving)

**Generated Candidates (25+ names):**
- Flow metaphors: flow, flux, stream, current
- Watching: watch, lookout, vigil, scout
- Clarity: lens, scope, vista, clarity
- Short variants: vx, vz, vq, vm
- Tech playful: flowtop, workspy, vibecheck
- Home/base: home, base, hub

### Technique 3: Brand Alignment Analysis (5 minutes)

**Top Finalists:**
1. **vx** - Ultra-short, distinctive (2 letters)
2. **vibe-dash** - Descriptive, clear purpose

**Evaluation Process:**
- Initial preference: vx for brevity
- Challenge identified: Brand disconnect between "vibe-dash" and "vx"
- Explored: vibeX as bridge concept
- Final insight: `vd` as natural abbreviation of `vibe-dash`

### Final Decision: vibe-dash (command: vd)

**Product Name:** vibe-dash  
**Primary Command:** `vd`  
**Alternative Command:** `vibe-dash` (explicit)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Direct & intuitive: `vd` = obvious abbreviation
- ✅ Brand alignment: Perfect match between name and command
- ✅ CLI-friendly: 2 letters, fast to type
- ✅ Descriptive: Full name conveys purpose
- ✅ Professional: More grounded than experimental `vx`

**Implementation:**
- Repository: `github.com/user/vibe-dash`
- Primary command: `vd`
- Package name: `vibe-dash`
- Documentation: "Install vibe-dash, use `vd` command"
