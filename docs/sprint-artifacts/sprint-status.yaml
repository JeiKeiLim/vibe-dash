# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted or in-progress
#   - done: Epic completed
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder by *create-story
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created by *story-ready
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation by *dev-story
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review by *code-review
#   - done: Story completed by *story-done
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done by *retrospective
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be marked `in-progress` before stories can be marked beyond `backlog`
# - SM typically drafts next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', dev reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'

  # Epic 6 Retro Action Items (HIGH PRIORITY)
  # Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/retrospectives/epic-6-retro-2025-12-25.md

  # 7-8: G24 - Deferred epic breaks stage detection
  # Problem: Epic 5 marked "deferred-post-mvp" causes "Unknown status" in TUI
  # Decision: Skip deferred epics in stage detection, normalize LLM variations
  # Pattern: Follow normalizeStatus() in internal/adapters/detection/bmad_stage.go (Story 4.6.3)
  # Variations to handle: deferred, Deferred, DEFERRED, deferred-post-mvp, deferred_post_mvp, epic-deferred

  # 7-9: G23 - Retrospective stage detection (from Epic 4.6 retro)
  # Problem: All epics done + retro in-progress shows "Unable to determine stage"
  # Decision: Show "Retrospective for Epic N in progress" or "All epics complete"

  # 7-10: M2 - Shared test helpers package
  # Problem: Test helpers duplicated across packages (mocks, fixtures, executeCommand)
  # Decision: Extract to internal/shared/testhelpers or similar
  # Carried forward: 6 times (since Epic 3)
  # Reference: epic-6-retro-2025-12-25.md → "Action Items" H1
  # DONE: 2025-12-26 - Code review passed, fixes applied

  # 7-12: DRY refactor - findProjectByIdentifier reuse
  # Problem: favorite.go and note.go duplicate project lookup logic from status.go
  # Locations: favorite.go:69-81, note.go:45-57 duplicate status.go:79-114
  # Decision: Refactor to call findProjectByIdentifier() from status.go
  # Reference: epic-6-retro-2025-12-25.md → "Action Items" H5

  # 7-13: Numeric story sorting
  # Problem: Stories sort lexicographically (7-10 before 7-2) instead of numerically
  # Impact: Dashboard shows wrong "next story" when story numbers exceed single digits
  # Root cause: stage_parser.go uses string comparison for sorting
  # Locations: stage_parser.go:241-242 (story sort), stage_parser.go:126 (epic sort)

  # Epic 8: UX Polish
